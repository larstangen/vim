SF -> OM Interface Known Requirements and Issues We Need to Address
###############################################################

1. Do not need to handle child service as that inherits the service 
2. If a line has a child add configured underneath we need to set it's top model line id to itself
	(Do we need to also set link_to_line_id?)
3. 


Check for top idx and query based on parent line_id
check for top idx and query based on child line_id
if both have values return top idx
